excerpt: 'Metaphase chromosome analysis is one of the primary
techniques utilized in cytogenetics. Observations of chromosomal segments or translocations during metaphase can
indicate structural changes in the cell genome, and is often used for diagnostic purposes. Karyotyping of the chromosomes micro-photographed under metaphase is done by
characterizing the individual chromosomes in cell spread
images. Currently, considerable effort and time is spent to
manually segment out chromosomes from cell images, and
classifying the segmented chromosomes into one of the 24
types, or for diseased cells to one of the known translocated
types. Segmenting out the chromosomes in such images can
be especially laborious and is often done manually, if there
are overlapping chromosomes in the image which are not
easily separable by image processing techniques. Many
techniques have been proposed to automate the segmentation and classification of chromosomes from spread images with reasonable accuracy, but given the criticality of
the domain, a human in the loop is often still required. In
this paper, we present a method to segment out and classify
chromosomes for healthy patients using a combination of
crowdsourcing, preprocessing and deep learning, wherein
the non-expert crowd from CrowdFlower is utilized to segment out the chromosomes from the cell image, which are
then straightened and fed into a (hierarchical) deep neural network for classification. Experiments are performed
on 400 real healthy patient images obtained from a hospital. Results are encouraging and promise to significantly
reduce the cognitive burden of segmenting and karyotyping
chromosomes.'
