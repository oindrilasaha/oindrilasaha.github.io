title: "Do Events Change Opinions on Social Media? Studying the 2016 US Presidential Debates"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/socialmedia
excerpt: 'Social media is the primary platform for discussions and reactions during various
social events. Studies in this space focus on the aggregate opinion and sentiment analysis
but fail to analyze the micro-dynamics. In this work, we present a case study of the 2016
US Presidential Debates, analyzing the user opinion micro-dynamics across the timeline.
We present an opinion variation analysis coupled with micro and macro level user analysis
in order to explain opinion change. We also identify and characterize varied user-groups
derived through this analyses. We discover that aggregate change in opinion is better 
explained by the differential influx of polarized population rather than the change in 
individual’s stance or opinion.'
