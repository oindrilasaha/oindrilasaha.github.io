About Me
==================
I an Research Scientist at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). Previously, I completed my PhD at the [UMass Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) working with [Prof. Subhransu Maji](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~smaji/). Before that, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, working with [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.prateekjain.org/) and [Dr. Harsha Simhadri](http://harsha-simhadri.org/). I earned my Bachelors and Masters from [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/).

I am interested in generating visual content with control and consistency. I am also interested in exploring effective methods for controlling generation. 

**Internships and Academic Collaborations.** If you are interested in these research directions and are interested in interning at Adobe Research or collaborating with me, please reach out!
