About Me
==================
I am a CS PhD student working at the UMass Amherst Computer Vision Lab under the supervision of [Prof. Subhransu Maji](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~smaji/) on data efficient learning algorithms. My previous projects include analyzing generative and contrastive models for discriminative tasks, using coarse supervision for improving segmentation, contrastive learning using part-based clustering. Recently, I have been working on enhancing zero-shot generalization of multimodal models, and exploring test-time capabilities of diffusion models. My interests include improving generative or discriminative models using various types or modes of supervision.  

Previously, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, working with [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.prateekjain.org/) and [Dr. Harsha Simhadri](http://harsha-simhadri.org/) on the [EdgeML](https://github.com/microsoft/EdgeML/) project. I worked on developing tiny and accurate Computer Vision models which can be deployed on severely resource-constrained devices. I have also collaborated with industry through internships at Adobe and Meta. I did my Bachelors and Masters in Tech. in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur.

Research Interests
==================
Self, Semi and Unsupervised learning, Multimodal Learning, Generative modeling
