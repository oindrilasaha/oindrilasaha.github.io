I am a first year PhD student at UMass Amherst working under the supervision of [Prof. Subhransu Maji](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~smaji/) on data efficient learning algorithms.

Previously, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, working with [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.prateekjain.org/), [Dr. Harsha Simhadri](http://harsha-simhadri.org/) and [Dr. Manik Varma](http://manikvarma.org/) on the [EdgeML](https://github.com/microsoft/EdgeML/) project. I worked on developing tiny and accurate Computer Vision models which can be deployed on severely resource-constrained devices.

I did my Bachelors and Masters in Tech. in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. Here I did my Thesis with [Prof. Debdoot Sheet](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~debdoot/) in medical imaging.

I am excited about research problems involving the design of efficient techniques for solving various Computer Vision problems. I am also interested in Vision algorithms inspired by human cognition.
